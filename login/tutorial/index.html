    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This tutorial should give you, dear reader, a concise introduction to the library structure
        and general architectural ideas of the login app.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll try to describe everything with short examples. If you have any further questions,
        you can write me to <a href="mailto:seong@respice.net">&lt;seong@respice.net&gt;</a>, though
        I hope after reading this document, this won't be necessary.
    </p>
    
    <h1>General Structure</h2>
    <p>
        If you check the repository, you will find the following directory tree: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>appplication</em> - Application related libraries (models, controller, etc.)</li>
        <li><em>htdocs</em> - Public directory for web-accessible files</li>
        <li><em>lib</em> - General libraries</li>
        <li><em>tests</em> - Unit tests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The directory structure follows the LM coding guidelines as described in
        <a href="http://dev.sendlove.us/taskforce/wiki/doku.php">http://dev.sendlove.us/taskforce/wiki/doku.php</a>
    </p>
    
    <h1>The General Library (lib)</h1>
    <h2>Loader</h2>
    <p>
        The loader is the autoloader (<a href="http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload.php">http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload.php</a>)
        implementation for the login app. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is, that you add classes and their respective filenames, where they are declared, to the
        autoloader. The autoloader will then be started when a class is used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a short example of the autoloader in use:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Test.php</strong>
        <pre>
class Test
{
}
        </pre>
        <strong>index.php</strong>
        <pre>
require_once 'lib/Loader.php';
require_onde 'lib/Loader/Loader_Exception.php';

Loader::registerClass('Test', 'Test.php');

$test = new Test();
        </pre>
    </p>
    
    <h2>DataObject</h2>
    <p>
        The DataObject is a utility class, which should help you solve common problems with models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually you want a simple container, which stores and handles data.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have a user class, you want to access it through different methods:
    </p>
    <pre>
$user = new User();
$user->setUsername('test');
$user->setPassword('password');
$user->setIsTestUser(true);
if ($user->hasUsername()) {
    echo $user->getUsername();
}
if ($user->hasPassword()) {
    echo $user->getPassword();
}
    </pre>
        The dataobject makes it easy for you to create such classes. If you wanted to implement a
        class, which would have the functionality described above, you would simply write: 
    </p>
    <pre>
class User extends DataObject
{
    protected $username;
    protected $password;
    protected $isTestUser;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        That's it. Note, that all handled members are 
        <pre>protected</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Overloading methods</h3>
    <p>        
        You could define your own get/set-methods, if you want. Just add them to your class.
    </p>
    <pre>
class User extends DataObject
{
    protected $username;
    protected $password;
    protected $isTestUser;
    
    public function setIsTestUser($isTestUser)
    {
        $this->isTestUser = (boolean) $isTestUser;
        return $this;
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Noticed, that we return the object itself? This is also the default behaviour, so we can
        make use of the method chaining.
    </p>
    <pre>
$user = new User();
$user->setUsername('test')
     ->setPassword('password')
     ->setIsTestUser(true);
    </pre>
    <h3>Other protected members</h3>
    <p>
        The DataObject takes all protected members and handles them. But what, if you had a
        member, which shouldn't be handled?
    </p>
    <pre>
class User extends DataObject
{
    protected $databaseConnection;
    protected $username;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->registerIgnoreProps(array('databaseConnection'));
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        The method
        <pre>DataObject::registerIgnoreProps()</pre>
        takes an array as an argument. Just list the names of the members, which shouldn't be handled
        by the DataObject.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also make sure, that you call the constructor from DataObject after you set the ignored 
        properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Going beyond</h3>
    <p>
        Just have a look at the user model in this application. You can find it under
        <em>application/model/User.php</em>. It's a nice example of how you can implement your data objects.
    </p>
