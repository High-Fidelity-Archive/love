= How to run tests =
Checkout login(logon) app from the repository.
Then navigate your browser to the following url:
http://dev.sendlove.us/~yoursandbox/login/tests/ui/
OR
http://dev.sendlove.us/~yoursandbox/login/trunk/tests/ui/
depending on the way you checked out the app

If everything is correct you should see this:

If you are new to the testing, make sure that you click on the button Tests Info which provides you with basic understanding 
on what each test does:

To run a test unit you need to check the box in front of its name and the click on Run Selected.

= How to write tests =

Make sure that you read PHPUnit manual: http://www.phpunit.de/
Open some of the tests and see how the tests are coded.
The basics for a working tests class are:
1. Make sure that you have included the bootstrap.php file
2. Make sure that your test class extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
3. Put your test class in Tests folder and make sure that it follows the way the other tests are named - ClassNameTest.php
4. Open the UI webpage and click on Reload Tests button to load your test:

4. If you need to write additional "helper" classes for your test class, put them in a folder created in Tests. Name that folder 
the same way as your test but don't include the extension(PHP), ClassNameTest, inside that folder you can put your helper classes.
It is very IMPORTANT to put proper names on those helper classes - add Test infront at the beginning of the file name.
Example:
My class name is: MyHelperClass
You need to put that class in a file named: TestMyHelperClass.php
By doing that you are telling the UI script to not parse that file and not to include it to the list of tests.
